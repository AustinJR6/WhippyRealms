# WhippyRealms

WhippyRealms is a fantasy RPG project built in Unity. It aims to create a dynamic, living world powered by AI-driven quests, evolving factions and responsive companions. The project is inspired by titles such as **Skyrim**, **Elden Ring** and old-school **Runescape**.

## Core Features

- **Open World Zones** – Modular scenes connected by portals and gates. Player progress persists across zones.
- **AI-Generated Quests** – Quests are generated on demand via GPT-style logic and tracked by the quest system.
- **Living Companions & Factions** – Companions react to player choices and factions track reputation dynamically.
- **Dialogue & Emotion** – NPC dialogue can be generated with emotional tone and optional voice playback.
- **Procedural Generation** – Dungeons, loot and enemies are generated to keep the world fresh.

## Getting Started

1. Install **Unity 2022.3 LTS** or newer.
2. Clone this repository and open the project in Unity.
3. The main scripts live in `Assets/Scripts`. Attach them to GameObjects as needed.
4. To run the sample scene, create a new scene and add a `GameManager` with `SceneLoader` and `SaveSystem` components.

## Minimal Viable Prototype
The `PrototypeGame` script demonstrates JSON-driven player creation and a basic combat encounter in the "Thornroot Paths" zone. Attach it and `DevConsole` to any GameObject to play with debug commands.


## Region Data

World regions are defined in `Assets/StreamingAssets/regions.json`. The new `RegionManager` script loads this file at runtime so you can expand the map without modifying code. Each entry describes a region name, controlling deity and recommended level range.

## Python Tools

Some AI integrations can be prototyped with Python. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `python cli_game.py` to try a lightweight text prototype that supports zone
navigation, combat, quests and basic dialogue. It uses the JSON files under
`Assets/StreamingAssets` for data and saves progress to `playerState.json`.

## Vision for Future Development

This repository serves as the foundation for a much larger world. Future updates will include:

- Deeper quest logic driven by GPTQuestEngine
- Richer faction reputation systems
- Procedurally generated wilderness and dungeons
- Voice acting using TTS engines
- Expanded lore, magic systems and world-building

Contributions and ideas are welcome as WhippyRealms grows into a fully realized RPG experience.

## The World of WhippyRealms

### Backstory: The Shattering of the Concord

Long ago, five great kingdoms forged a **Concord of Light** — a pact to keep the balance between mortal realms and the Veil, a mysterious layer of unseen power that separated the living world from the unknowable. For centuries, peace flourished under the wisdom of the Concord Council — until one kingdom broke the pact, hungry to control the Veil itself.

The Sundering War that followed shattered the Veil. Magic spilled like blood across the land. Kingdoms fell, forests warped and seas split. Now, centuries later, remnants of the old world linger… and new powers rise in their shadows.

Era II: Age of Illusions — The Fracturing Veil
Also known as: The Dreamwoven Age, The Time of Masks, The Silent Schism
Summary
This age marked the emergence of mortal dreams, illusions, and the veiling of divine truth. As the world stabilized, Selavara—the Moonweaver—began weaving the Dreamweave, a metaphysical lattice of thought and perception that blurred the line between reality and desire. The gods withdrew from the world more fully, leaving their echoes and symbols to guide mortals. Selavara’s growing power unsettled the pantheon—especially Elys, who began chronicling reality as it was, not as it was seen. This led to the first divine schism.
Major Events
• The Dreamweave Unveiled — Selavara seeded the world with fragments of her own mind. These became the Veils—reflections that subtly influenced mortal desire and thought.
• Rise of the Masked Cities — Cities like Velalune and Shivareth emerged, designed to reflect inner identity instead of objective truth. Mask-wearing became law.
• The Chrono-Faults — Elys responded to the Veils by stitching Time tighter around unstable regions, leading to areas where reality loops or splits unpredictably.
• The Silent Schism — A metaphysical rupture between Selavara and Elys. Though no war was declared, temples were divided, and dream-based magic was banned in Elystren.
• The First Mirrorshatter — A failed attempt to sever the Dreamweave entirely. It caused a wave of madness and memory inversion in Selenora.
Geography Transformed in This Era
• The Prism Vault (Selavara’s sanctuary of light-echoes)
• Shiverglass Marsh (formed from a broken veil drop)
• The Reflection Hollows (memory caves born from split timelines)
• Crescent Hollow (amplified by Dreamweave influence)
Divine Roles Recast
• Selavara — Became the goddess of dreams, secrets, and self-reinvention.
• Elys — Cemented their role as the steward of reality and fate’s timeline, leading to the birth of the Hourbound.
• Thalrion — Began appearing in mortal dreams, seeding prophecies and storms tied to emotion.
• Vokar — Whispered into the first death-dreams, beginning his subtle entrance into the pantheon.
• Myrielle — Grew distant, confused by the growing separation between life’s truth and its illusions.
Cultural Legacy
• Dream interpretation became a global obsession.
• Prophets, illusionists, and seers rose in status—often surpassing kings and generals in influence.
• The Moonwar Hymns were written, cryptic songs that reveal divine truths when sung during eclipses.
• Masks forged from soulglass began to store memories and reshape identity over time.

Era V: The Whispered War — Age of Hidden Truths
Also known as: The Shadow Age, The War Behind the Veil, The Time of Unseen Wounds
Summary
This ongoing era is a cold war waged in dreams, shadows, and silence. It is fought not with armies, but with forgotten names, stolen memories, and veiled truths. Selenora and Vokaria, once distant but respectful powers, have begun to drift into silent conflict. At the heart of the tension lies a philosophical divide: Should truth be revealed through death or concealed for protection? The consequences are subtle but widespread, reshaping prophecy, memory, and mortal belief across all realms.
Major Events
• The First Lantern Shatter — A soul-lantern in Vokaria exploded when exposed to a forbidden reflection shard from Selenora. The memory within scattered across dreams.
• The Moonveil Breaks — An illusion in Shivareth collapsed, revealing a vast memory archive stolen from dying minds. This event was never publicly acknowledged.
• Rise of the Lanternbound Inquisition — Vokaria’s silent monks now investigate and confiscate all unauthorized memory artifacts.
• The Veilforged Pact — A failed attempt at reconciliation. It ended with the disappearance of a shared oracle known as *The Namekeeper*.
• Prophetic Collapse — Temples of Elys reported prophecy distortions. Some future threads now appear reversed, blank, or mirrored.
Realms Affected
• Selenora — Fortifying its veils and dream boundaries. Trust in the Shroud Circle is wavering.
• Vokaria — Lantern production and soul recordkeeping have doubled. Paranoia is spreading among the bonewright houses.
• Elystren — Fate distortions are being recorded, but the Spiral Archive refuses to act. Internal debates fracture the Threadkeepers.
• Verdancia & Durndara — Though not direct participants, they've reported psychic plant decay and resonance fractures in the stone tunnels.
Divine Involvement
• Selavara — Has remained silent, though her veil signs appear more frequently. Some seers believe she’s already lost control of the Dreamweave.
• Vokar — Quietly active, enforcing silence where he once merely observed. Dreams of him now end in cold stillness or vanishing stars.
• Elys — Neither condemns nor intervenes. Some believe Elys is simply watching to see who wins the philosophical war.
• Myrielle — Concerned with dream-corruption affecting sacred groves. The Rootseers have begun planting Memory Blossoms as warding agents.
Cultural Consequences
• The Era of Masks Reborn — In Selenora, masks are no longer just symbolic. Some now alter the wearer’s memories.
• Soulburning — A new forbidden rite in Vokaria, used to extract secrets from corrupted lanterns. It is deeply controversial.
• Mirror Oracles — Illicit figures who charge for stolen truths glimpsed through memory mirrors. Highly hunted by Lanternbound.
• The Echo Doctrine — A philosophical movement proposing that every truth must be echoed once in death and once in dream to be complete.
Era I: Pre-Mortal — Age of Flame & Form
Also known as: The First Light, The Silent Dawn, The Shaping Age
Summary
This was the age before mortals, when the gods were not merely worshipped—they walked the world in their truest forms. The cosmos was raw, brimming with chaotic matter, divine fire, and unbound time. The pantheon had only just taken shape, and the world was still a shifting storm of possibility. The three great shapers—Aurelios, Myrielle, and Durnek—each began to impose their will upon the formless realm. They crafted land, law, and life—but not without friction. Ignara and Thalrion, born of primal energy, resisted order at every turn. And Selavara, even then, was elusive.
Major Events
• The First Hammerfall — Durnek strikes the world’s molten shell with his divine hammer, forging the mountain ranges, tectonic bones, and cavern hearts of what would become Durndara. Each strike birthed a pulse of time—believed to be the origin of linear memory.
• The Sunbirth Ritual — Aurelios ascended into the sky and lit the world with his own heartfire. This became the sun, and its rising established the cycle of day and night. It also birthed the first concept of justice, as light revealed what was hidden.
• The Verdant Spark — Myrielle planted the first grove in the center of the new world. It became Aril’shae, the birthplace of all living things. From this grove sprang the blueprints for flora and fauna—encoded into what would later be called the Rootweave.
• The Chaos Bloom — Ignara and Thalrion, furious at the shaping of the world, struck it together—a storm of flame and tide. Their combined fury birthed the Emberwilds and the Shifting Archipelago. From this came the first Leviathans and Flame Wyrms.
• The Dawnbreak Accord — As destruction spiraled out of control, Aurelios proposed a divine accord. Myrielle and Durnek agreed—wanting to preserve what they’d created. Reluctantly, Thalrion signed. Ignara did not. Elys, born of the Accord itself, recorded the pact and began weaving the Thread of Time.
Geography Created in This Era
• The Spinewall Mountains (Durnek’s First Strike)
• The Sunrift Plateau (Aurelios' Ascension)
• The Bloomshade Expanse (Myrielle’s Grove)
• The Leviathan Gate (Thalrion’s Rebellion)
• The Ashmirror Crater (Ignara’s Wrath)
• The Cradle of Choice (Elys’s first anomaly)
Divine Roles Defined
• Aurelios — Architect of divine law and sacred time.
• Durnek — Forgemaster of form and permanence.
• Myrielle — Soul-giver, tied to fertility and rebirth.
• Ignara — Force of divine rebellion and transformation.
• Thalrion — Chaos in motion—tied to storms, moods, and change.
• Selavara — Observer of veils, began the Dreamweave.
• Elys — Emerged as impartial witness—silent, powerful, endless.
• Vokar — Not yet present. Would arrive in the next age, at the first death.
